    <summary>The Pothos framework and its respective data processing toolkits</summary>
    <description>The Pothos project is a complete data-flow framework for creating topologies of interconnected processing blocks. Topologies can be designed and tested graphically, and deployed over a network. The Pothos framework API enables users to quickly create custom processing blocks with minimal boiler-plate. Processing blocks can support computational offload and integration with SoC and DMA devices. The project also has a diverse set of processing and hardware support toolkits.
  
The Pothos SDR development environment makes it easy for Windows users to start exploring and developing in the exciting ecosystem of open-source software-defined radio. We bundle as much as we can into a single installer, pulling in not just Pothos and SoapySDR projects, but other big frameworks and applications such as GNU Radio, GQRX, and CubicSDR. </description>
